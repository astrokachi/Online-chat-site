          <p>
            Although Our site is not based in the United States, we respect the intellectual property rights of
            copyright holders, and thus voluntarily comply with the Notice and Takedown provisions of the Digital
            Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”). We do not permit copyright infringing activities or infringement
            of intellectual property rights on Our Site, and will promptly and without prior notice remove all content
            if properly notified of infringements on third party’s intellectual property rights. Repeat infringers will
            have their access and/or privileges terminated.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Our website (“site”) qualifies as a “Service Provider” within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. §512(k)(1) of the
            Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”). Consequently, it is entitled to a certain protection
            against claims of copyright infringement under the DMCA, commonly referred to as the “safe harbor”
            provisions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>We have also registered a specific DMCA Agent, the information for which is provided below.</p>

          <br />

          <p>
            We take claims of copyright infringement very seriously and respond to notices regarding such matters
            expeditiously. If you are a copyright owner, or authorized to act on behalf of a copyright owner, you may
            report claims of copyright infringement to us, by sending a DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement, containing
            the following:
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            1. Identification, including a description, of the copyrighted work you are claiming has been infringed. If
            you are claiming infringement of multiple works, you may provide a representative list.
          </p>

          <p>
            2. The location of the allegedly infringing material, including identification of URL where the allegedly
            infringing material is accessible or the exact location where the infringing material can be found.
          </p>

          <p>3. Your company affiliation, if applicable, your mailing address, telephone number, and email address.</p>

          <p>
            4. A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use is not authorized by the copyright owner or
            other intellectual property rights owner, by its agent, or by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            5. A statement by you under penalty of perjury that the information in your notice is accurate and that you
            are the copyright or intellectual property owner or are authorized to act on the owner's behalf.

          <section className="">
            <header className="font-bold text-2xl">1. Take Down Procedure</header>
            <br />
            <p>
              Our site implements the following “notification and takedown” procedure upon receipt of any notification
              of claimed copyright infringement. Our site reserves the right at any time to disable access to, or remove
              any material or activity accessible on or from any site or any materials claimed to be infringing or based
              on facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent. It is the firm policy of our site to
              terminate the account of repeat copyright infringers, should such an account exist, when appropriate, and
              our site will act expeditiously to remove access to all material that infringes on another’s copyright,
              according to the procedure set forth in 17 U.S.C. §512 of the “DMCA”. Our site’s DMCA Notice Procedures
              are set forth in the preceding paragraph. If the notice does not comply with §512 of the DMCA, but does
              comply with three requirements for identifying sites that are infringing according to §512 of the DMCA,
              our site shall attempt to contact or take other reasonable steps to contact the complaining party to help
              that party comply with the notice requirements. When the Designated Agent receives a valid notice, our
              site will expeditiously remove and/or disable access to the infringing material and shall notify the
              affected user.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Then, the affected user may submit a counter-notification to the Designated Agent containing a statement
              made under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed because
              of misidentification of the material. After the Designated Agent receives the counter-notification, it
              will replace the material at issue within 10-14 days after receipt of the counter-notification unless the
              Designated Agent receives notice that a court action has been filed by the complaining party seeking an
              injunction against the infringing activity. Our site reserves the right to modify, alter or add to this
              policy, and all users should regularly check back to these Terms and Conditions to stay current on any
              such changes.

            <header className="font-bold text-2xl">2. Abuse Notification</header>
            <br />
            <p>
              Abusing the DMCA Notice procedures set forth above, or misrepresenting facts in a DMCA Notice or
              Counter-notification, can result in legal liability for damages, court costs and attorneys fees under U.S.
              federal law. See; 17 U.S.C. §512(f). This Notice and Takedown Procedures only apply to claims of copyright
              infringement by copyright holders and their agents – not to any other kind of abuse, infringement or legal
              claim. We will investigate and take action against anyone abusing the DMCA notification or
              counter-notification procedure. Please ensure that you meet all of the legal qualifications before
              submitting a DMCA Notice to our Designated Agent.

            <br />
            <p>
              If the Recipient of a Notice of Claimed Infringement (“Notice”) believes that the Notice is erroneous or
              false, and/or that allegedly infringing material has been wrongly removed in accordance with the
              procedures outlined above, the Recipient is permitted to submit a counter-notification pursuant to Section
              512(g)(2)&(3) of the DMCA. A counter-notification is the proper method for the Recipient to dispute the
              removal or disabling of material pursuant to a Notice. The information that a Recipient provides in a
              counter-notification must be accurate and truthful, and the Recipient will be liable for any
              misrepresentations which may cause any claims to be brought against our site relating to the actions taken
              in response to the counter-notification.

              It is our policy to terminate access to our Website and revoke privileges of any person who we determine

              but will include any individual who has been the subject of more than one copyright infringement notice.
              Nothing in this policy waives any other right we may have to pursue copyright infringers or any other
              individual who uses our Website to violate the intellectual property rights of others. We will not
              indemnify any alleged infringer in any manner
